# DATE'25 "Timing-Driven Global Placement by Efficient Critical Path Extraction"
We provide the implementation of the method proposed in the paper. It is built upon the popular open-source infrastructure [DREAMPlace](https://github.com/limbo018/DREAMPlace).

## Build with Docker

We highly recommend the use of Docker to enable a smooth environment configuration.

The following steps are borrowed from [DREAMPlace](https://github.com/limbo018/DREAMPlace) repository. We make minor revisions to make it more clear.

1. Get the code and put it in folder `DATE25-TDP`.

2. Get the container:

- Option 1: pull from the cloud [limbo018/dreamplace](https://hub.docker.com/r/limbo018/dreamplace).

  ```
  docker pull limbo018/dreamplace:cuda
  ```

- Option 2: build the container.

  ```
  docker build . --file Dockerfile --tag your_name/dreamplace:cuda
  ```

3. Enter bash environment of the container. Replace `limbo018` with your name if option 2 is chosen in the previous step.

- Option 1: Run with GPU on Linux.

  ```
  docker run --gpus 1 -it -v $(pwd):/DATE25-TDP limbo018/dreamplace:cuda bash
  ```

- Option 2: Run with CPU on Linux.

  ```
  docker run -it -v $(pwd):/DREAMPlace limbo018/dreamplace:cuda bash
  ```

4. ` cd /DATE25-TDP`.

5. Build.

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. 
   make
   make install
   ```

6. Get benchmarks: download the cases here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xeauwLR9lOxnYvsK2JGPSY0INQh8VuE4/view?usp=sharing. Unzip the package and put it in the following directory:

   ```
   install/benchmarks/iccad2015.ot
   ```

## Test

Run our method on case superblue1 of ICCAD2015 timing-driven placement contest:

```
python dreamplace/Placer.py test/iccad2015.pin2pin/$case.json
```

Or you can run all 8 cases by:

```
cd install
./run.sh
```
